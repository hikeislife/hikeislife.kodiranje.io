        <li>starts at: 2:37</li>
        <li>ellipsis example of es5 and es6 19:29</li>
        <li>module 20:10 - originaly code units used to communicate to eachother using global variables. node replaced it with "crappy required" which is blocking so ... es6 provides module system which is async and can give you secure, reliable model boundries which is what we need. </li>
        <li>weak map 22:08 - the fact that keys of an object have to be strings, is a design error in js, which can't be fixed now because of all the code relying on it. if you try to pass it an object as a key, it will try to convert it into a string before using it as a key, which is a shame, as so many applications really want an object in that position. weak map is like an object, but now keys can be other objects. really good, crappy name, works well with garbage collector.</li>

        <li>about paradigm shifts 36:15</li>
        <li>o closure-ima i kako je alokacija memorije pomerena sa šteka na hiip čime je postignuto da unutrašnja f ima pristup varijablama definisanim u spoljnoj f. garbage collector kasnije počisti hiip 45:37 this is something js figured out, and now all other languages are trying to replicate this. see waht alocation actually means, where the references stored? does this mean even primitives are stored on the heap? def research this further.</li>
        <li>making objects in a class free, prototype independent way 48:00</li>
        <li>explains why we have int overflow and why we use complement of 2 arithmentic 52:00</li>
        <li>explains why floating point IEEE whatever number standard is out of whack 56:08</li>
        <li>DEC64 his number standard suggestion 58:56</li>
